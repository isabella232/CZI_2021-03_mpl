To support the continued maintenance, growth, development, and community
engagement of Matplotlib, the foundational plotting library of the Scientific
Python Ecosystem.

Matplotlib is the foundational data visualization library for the Scientific
Python Ecosystem, with over a million users, including researchers in
bio-medical imaging, microscopy, and genomics.
For the past 18 years Matplotlib has been maintained by a vibrant, primarily
volunteer, community.  However given the sheer size of the project and
adoption, we need to supplement the volunteer community with supported full
time maintainers working on the project.  For the past 17 months CZI EOSS
support for developers has had a positive effect on the project by
complementing and enabling, not replacing, volunteer work: we propose to
continue this effort.

The primary component of the proposed work is the continued maintenance of the
library.  Maintenance tasks are essential for the project's health; though each
individually is small, they are frequently time critical and tedious.  In
addition to on-going and routine maintenance, there are substantial, but
incremental, enhancement to Matplotlib that require long blocks of dedicated
effort to implement. Finally, supported developers improve the management of
the project.  We now have the time and bandwidth to make strategic decisions
about the direction of the project to ensure the long term health and viability
of Matplotlib.

An important part of project management is community management: fostering,
diversifying, and growing our community.  We must ensure that our community is
open and welcoming to everyone who wants to join, with opportunities to
contribute in a spectrum of roles as their interests and skills develop.

Matplotlib is the foundational data visualization library for the Scientific
Python Ecosystem, with over a million users, including researchers in
bio-medical imaging, microscopy, and genomics.  For the past 18 years
Matplotlib has been maintained by a vibrant, primarily volunteer, community.
However we have grown too big and widely used to continue on solely volunteer
effort.  For the past 15 months CZI EOSS support for developers has had a
positive effect on the project by complementing and enabling, not replacing,
volunteer work.  We propose to continue this effort.



The primary component of the proposed work is the continued maintenance of the
library.  Maintenance covers a wide range of tasks including triaging and
fixing bugs, reviewing Pull Requests, tagging and building releases, and
keeping the continuous integration services running.  These tasks are essential
for the project's health; though each individually is small, they are
frequently time critical and tedious.  It is unfair and impractical to rely
solely on volunteers to accomplish such tasks.


With only volunteer effort we had an ever growing backlog of Issues and PRs.
This risks missing good ideas and is both discouraging to new contributors and
distracting to the core developers.  In contrast, with CZI support we have
decreased our backlog of open Issues and PRs despite an increase in the number
submitted over the last 15 months.


In addition to on-going and routine maintenance, there are substantial, but
incremental, enhancement to Matplotlib that require long blocks of dedicated
effort to implement.  Without funding, this type of project can drag out for
months to years or stall altogether.  Examples include fixing long-standing
rendering and performance issues, deep-dive explanatory documentation,
homogenizing and smoothing the API, and new user-facing functionality.
Projects to be pursued with the funding requested here will be selected in
consultation with down-stream biomedical libraries.



Finally, supported developers improve the management of the project.  We now
have the time and bandwidth to make strategic decisions about the direction of
the project to ensure the long term health and viability of Matplotlib.  An
important part of project management is community management: fostering,
diversifying, and growing our community.  This requires dedicated effort, over
long periods of time, beyond what can be sustained by volunteers alone.  We
must ensure that our community is open and welcoming to everyone who wants to
join, with opportunities to contribute in a spectrum of roles as their
interests and skills develop.


We propose to continue full support (1 FTE) for Elliott Sales de Andrade and
partial support (.2 FTE) for Thomas Caswell.  The effort will be split with
approximately .75 FTE for maintenance, .25 FTE for medium sized enhancements,
and .2 FTE for community and project management. We also propose to fund Code
of Conduct incident response training for the community.



## work plan

> A description of the proposed work the applicants are requesting funding for,
> including resources the applicants will provide that are not part of the
> requested funding. For software development-related work (e.g., engineering,
> product design, user research), specify how the work fits into the existing

> 750 words

The proposed work can be broadly classified into three parts:

- on-going and routine maintenance of Matplotlib;
- implementation of several mid-sized features;
- community and project management.

These tasks underpin the long term health of the library but are ill-suited to
be accomplished with solely volunteer effort.

The primary component of the proposed work is the continued maintenance of the
Matplotlib.  Maintenance covers a wide range of tasks including triaging and
fixing bugs, reviewing Pull Requests, tagging and building releases, and
keeping the continuous integration services running.  These tasks are essential
for the project's health; though each individually is small, they are
frequently time critical and tedious.  It is unfair and impractical to rely
solely on volunteers to accomplish such tasks.

Prior to 2020, with only volunteer effort, we had an ever growing backlog of
Issues and PRs.  A large backlog of open Issues and PRs is discouraging to new
contributors and distracting to the core developers.  It is almost certain that
good ideas, critical bugs, and beneficial contributions are being
unintentionally overlooked.  In contrast, with CZI support we have decreased
our backlog of open Issues and PRs despite an increase in the number opened
over the last 15 months.

Maintaining Continuous Integration (CI) is required for the routine flow of
contributions and core part of our quality assurance process.  On every PR and
merge to the default branch we run our full test suite and build the
documentation on a matrix of supported versions of Python, our dependencies,
and the major operating systems.  While the service provides offer free
resources to open source projects, significant work and specialized knowledge
is needed to configure and maintain them.  Having supported developers who can
prioritize this work enables the entire community.

In addition to routine maintenance tasks, there are substantial but incremental
improvements that require long blocks of dedicated work.  These tasks include
fixing long-standing rendering and performance issues, deep-dive documentation,
homogenizing and smoothing the API, and new user-facing functionality.
Completed examples previous grant cycles include finishing a 5 year old
documentation PR, implementing hi-dpi support for Tk, and modernizing the parts
of the c++ code base, while work is on-going to add a color-blind simulation
filter to the UI to facilitate accessible visualization.  Candidates for future
work include overhauling how implement automatic layout optimization and
expanding our API for hatching.  Funding would allow us to tackle about 10 such
medium-sized, self-contained projects over two years with about a quarter of an
FTE/year.  Without funding, this type of project can drag out for months or
stall altogether.

The most valuable aspect of the Matplotlib project is the community.  While the
code is what enables our users to get their jobs done, the people who build and
support the code, are the heart of the project.  As with the code, we need to
maintain, support, and grow the community through intentional actions.  This
requires dedicated effort, over long periods of time, beyond what can be
sustained by volunteers alone.  We must ensure that our community is open and
welcoming to everyone who wants to join, with opportunities to contribute in a
spectrum of roles as their interests and skills develop.

The lack of diversity if open source is bigger problem than can be solved by a
single project alone; to that end we propose to collaborate with other ongoing
and proposed efforts.  NumFOCUS is currently conducting research on Contributor
Diversification and Retention to collect baseline measurements of our
demographics and produce recommendations on best practices of attracting and
retaining diverse contributors.  We will use the resources from this proposal
to implement those recommendations, which should be preliminary available in
Q2 2022. Additionally, Matplotlib is supporting a proposal to the Essential
Open Source Software for Science Diversity and Inclusion Grants RFA lead by
Melissa MendonÃ§a to create and fund a Contributor Experience Lead (CEL) role
across Numpy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib which would run concurrently with
this proposal.  We will use resources from this proposal to support the CEL
and implement their recommendations.

We propose to continue full support (1 FTE) for Elliott Sales de Andre and
partial support (.2 FTE) for Thomas Caswell along with travel and equipment
support.  The effort will be split with approximately .75 FTE for maintenance,
.25 FTE for medium sized enhancements, and .2 FTE for community and project
management.  We also propose to fund Code of Conduct incident response training
for the community.

Quantitatively evaluating maintenance work can be tricky---some Issues or PRs
take minutes to review while others can take days to weeks of effort---but we
believe that there is value at looking at the throughput of issues and PRs
supported by the grant.  The total number of open issues and PRs is dependent
on both how many come in and the amount of work done by volunteers.  We will
aim to hit the following metrics:

- Initial response to all issues / new PRs within a week
- Resolve majority of new issues / PRs within 1 month
- Review and resolve 100 issues / quarter
- Reduce and merge or close 100 PRs / quarter

We will aim to complete 9 mid-sized projects of similar scope to those
described above.  The exact projects will be determined in collaboration with
the community and downstream bio libraries.

We will maintain our current release cadence of a feature releases (3.N.0) every
6 months and  2-3 patch releases (3.N.X) between feature releases.

As mentioned above, Matplotlib is involved in on-going and proposed work on
improving diversity in our community.  We will implement the recommendations of
those efforts and, if funded, support the Matplotlib Contributor Experience
Lead.



## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Statement

> Advancing DEI is a core value for CZI, and we are requesting information on
> your efforts in this area. Describe any efforts the software project(s)
> named in this proposal have undertaken to increase diversity, equity, and
> inclusion with respect to their contributors and audience.  Please see
> examples from applications funded in previous cycles â€‹(maximum of 250 words)


Matplotlib is committed to being an open and welcoming project. We believe that
transparency and explicitness of process and in communication are key to
building an inclusive, equitable, and diverse project. In our effort to be
welcoming, we have worked at being more explicit about our norms and values and
how the project operates. To this end, we have put major effort into
documenting our governance and defining leadership roles, and clarifying
specific expectations for new code and community contributors.  We have started
two initiatives to lower the barrier of entry for individuals to get
involved in developing Matplotlib:: an triage role in the project and an
"incubator" channel on our gitter.  It is critical that all contributors,
independent of experience level both in general and with the project, feel safe
to make mistakes and learn in our community.  We strive to embody these values
in our interactions on github, our mailing list and community discussion forum
(discourse), and in our social media.  We hope that these practices will
empower and encourage people who have diverse identities to participate in
Matplotlib.

## Short description

> Short description of software project (200 words maximum) (required)

> 125 words
> this is what we put is for round 3 and is lifted from the website


Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality
figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across
platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython
shells, the Jupyter notebook/lab, web application servers, and four graphical
user interface toolkits.

Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. You can
generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts,
scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code.

For simple plotting the pyplot module provides a MATLAB-like interface,
particularly when combined with IPython. For the power user, you have full
control of line styles, font properties, axes properties, etc, via an object
oriented interface or via a set of functions familiar to MATLAB users.
